# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-18
**Phases:** 1-8
**Total Plans:** 18

## Overview

MedTriads v1.0 MVP built in eight phases: data models first, then core quiz mechanics, followed by complete screen flow, game mechanics (scoring and timer), feedback systems, navigation with study mode, polish (animations and sounds), and finally cleanup (tech debt closure). Each phase delivered a testable capability, building toward the complete game-like quiz experience.

### Phase 4: Game Mechanics

**Goal**: Scoring and timer systems create engaging gameplay pressure
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md - Scoring service, reducer extension, speed bonus and combo tier logic
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md - Timer color transitions, floating points, combo pulse, cancel button

**Details:**
- 100 base points per correct answer
- Quadratic speed bonus (0-50 points based on time remaining)
- Combo multiplier: 1x → 2x → 3x at 3/6 consecutive correct
- +500 bonus for perfect 10/10 round
- Timer ring color: blue → yellow (<5s) → red (<3s)
- Floating points animation, combo pulse on tier increase

### Phase 5: Feedback & Persistence

**Goal**: User receives clear feedback on answers and progress persists across sessions
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md - Visual answer feedback (faded state, thick borders, 1.5s delay)
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md - Haptic feedback refinement (consistent Light style)
- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md - Data persistence (high score, daily streak, total quizzes)

**Details:**
- Green highlight for correct, red for incorrect with correct answer revealed
- Consistent Light haptic style for all interactions
- AsyncStorage persistence for high score, daily streak, total quizzes
- toDateString for timezone-safe streak calculation

### Phase 6: Navigation & Study Mode

**Goal**: Users can navigate between app sections, study triads, customize settings, and share the app
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md - Tab bar navigation structure (4 tabs with icons)
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md - Library screen with triad browsing (accordion categories)
- [x] 06-03-PLAN.md - Progress screen with stats and history
- [x] 06-04-PLAN.md - Settings screen with toggles and share

**Details:**
- 4-tab navigation: Home, Library, Progress, Settings
- SF Symbols with filled/unfilled toggle for active state
- Library with collapsible category sections and triad details
- Progress with accuracy stats, category breakdown, quiz history (50 entry limit)
- Settings with sound/haptics toggles and iOS share sheet

### Phase 7: Polish

**Goal**: Animations and sounds create satisfying, game-like experience
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md - Timer pulse urgency animation and enhanced button press scale
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md - Sound effects hook, score count-up, confetti for perfect rounds

**Details:**
- Timer ring pulse animation in final 3 seconds
- Button scale 0.95 on press with bouncy release
- expo-audio for sound effects (correct/incorrect/combo)
- Score count-up animation on results screen
- Confetti burst for perfect 10/10 rounds
- Bouncy high score badge entrance

### Phase 8: Cleanup

**Goal**: Close tech debt identified in milestone audit for clean v1 release
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 08-01-PLAN.md - useHaptics hook, wire to quiz and tabs, remove orphaned exports

**Details:**
- Created useHaptics hook following useSoundEffects pattern
- Wired haptics to quiz and tab bar with settings integration
- Removed orphaned getRandomTriads from triads.ts
- Removed orphaned isNewUser from stats-storage.ts

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- React Native/Expo over SwiftUI (existing codebase, cross-platform future)
- No backend for MVP (local-only sufficient)
- iOS-first (iPhone only, no Android/iPad)
- Tuple type [string, string, string] for compile-time findings enforcement
- Same-category distractor preference for educational value
- Quadratic speed bonus curve for front-loaded rewards
- Combo tier at 3/6 consecutive correct for achievable progression
- 50-entry quiz history limit to prevent unbounded storage

**Issues Resolved:**

- Haptics setting not respected — fixed with useHaptics hook in Phase 8
- Orphaned exports (getRandomTriads, isNewUser) — removed in Phase 8
- expo-router typed routes — resolved with tsconfig regeneration

**Issues Deferred:**

- None — all tech debt addressed in Phase 8

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None remaining
