## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent context from research:
- Level system extends existing mastery.ts (6 tiers: Student -> Chief)
- Mascot switching partially implemented in TriMascot
- UI polish = applying existing theme tokens systematically
- Existing users must NOT see onboarding (check gamesPlayed > 0)
- Share feature generates styled image card for iOS share sheet

Phase 9 decisions:
- Content vs Navigation padding: Main scrollable content uses Spacing.lg (24px), compact headers use Spacing.base (16px)
- Entry animations use FadeInUp.delay(N * Durations.stagger).duration(Durations.normal).springify()
- Section header pattern: uppercase label + decorative line with flex: 1
- Card styling: backgroundSecondary, Radius.lg, minHeight: 100

Phase 10 decisions:
- Motion design: Soft, weighted, physical - springs over timing, nothing snaps, everything settles
- Easings.press for button interactions (damping: 15, stiffness: 400)
- Easings.bouncy for playful reveals (damping: 10, stiffness: 300)
- Easings.gentle for slow settles (damping: 20, stiffness: 150)
- Easings.pop for fast initial + slow settle (damping: 8, stiffness: 400)
- Celebratory pop pattern: withSequence(withSpring(1.35, Easings.pop), withSpring(1, Easings.gentle))
- Glow effect: Absolute positioned layer behind badge with animated opacity at 30% max
- Timer color interpolation: teal (100%) -> yellow (33%) -> red (20%) for urgency
- Timer pulse intensity: Critical (1.25 scale + pop), Warning (1.15 scale + bouncy)
- Button depth compression: 3px -> 1px on press via animated borderBottomWidth
- Correct answer pop: withSequence(pop, gentle) for overshoot + settle
