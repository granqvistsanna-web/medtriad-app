## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- No backend for MVP (local-only sufficient for quiz app)
- iOS-first (iPhone only, no Android/iPad for MVP)
- Tuple type [string, string, string] enforces exactly 3 findings at compile time (01-01)
- 10 medical categories covering major specialties (01-01)
- 45 triads with minimum 4 per category for distractor selection (01-01)

### Pending Todos
