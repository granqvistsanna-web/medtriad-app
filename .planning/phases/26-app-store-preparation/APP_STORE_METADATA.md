**Master Medical Triads with Game-Like Learning**

Test your knowledge of classic medical triads - the three-finding patterns that define key diagnoses. Perfect for medical students, nursing students, and healthcare professionals preparing for boards or clinical practice.

**How It Works**

Each round presents a triad of clinical findings. Can you identify the condition before time runs out? Earn points for speed and accuracy, build combos with consecutive correct answers, and climb the ranks from Student to Chief.

**Key Features**

- 45 medical triads across 10 clinical categories
- Timed Quiz Mode with speed bonuses and combo multipliers
- Study Mode for relaxed, untimed learning with explanations
- 6-tier progression system: Student to Chief
- Track your mastery across cardiology, neurology, pulmonary, and more
- Mark tricky questions for focused review
- Challenge friends by sharing your scores
- Beautiful, intuitive interface designed for quick study sessions

**Categories Include**

Cardiology, Neurology, Pulmonary, Endocrine, Rheumatology, Gastroenterology, Hematology, Infectious Disease, Obstetrics/Gynecology, and Nephrology.

**Why MedTriad?**

Medical triads are fundamental diagnostic patterns tested on USMLE, COMLEX, NCLEX, and clinical rotations. Our game-like approach makes repetition engaging rather than tedious. Each 2-minute quiz session fits perfectly into a busy schedule.

**Privacy First**

All your progress stays on your device. No accounts, no cloud sync, no data collection. Just you and your learning.

Download MedTriad and start mastering the triads that define clinical medicine.

### Keyword Strategy Notes

- **Included:** Core terms (medical, triad, quiz), audience terms (nursing, USMLE, boards), activity terms (study, flashcards)
- **Excluded from keywords:** "MedTriad" (already in title), "Medicine" (redundant with "medical")
- **Singular forms:** Apple combines singulars for plurals automatically
- **Long-tail focus:** Less competition for specific terms like "triad" and "USMLE"

## Category Selection

### Primary Category

**Medical**

*Rationale:* Directly targets healthcare professionals and students. Less competition than Education category. Apple's Medical category includes "Reference" and "Education" subcategories which fit our app.

### Secondary Category

**Education**

*Rationale:* Captures broader audience searching for learning apps. Quiz apps are commonly found in Education.
