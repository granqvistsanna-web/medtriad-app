<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Privacy Policy link to Settings screen</name>
  <files>medtriad/app/(tabs)/settings.tsx</files>
  <action>
Add a Privacy Policy row to the ABOUT section in Settings:

1. Import `Linking` from react-native
2. Import a privacy/legal icon from @solar-icons/react-native/Bold (use `DocumentText` or `Shield`)
3. Add a `handlePrivacyPolicy` function:
   ```typescript
   const handlePrivacyPolicy = () => {
     // TODO: Replace with actual privacy policy URL before submission
     Linking.openURL('https://YOUR_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL');
   };
   ```

4. Add SettingsRow in ABOUT section (after Version row):
   ```tsx
   <View style={[styles.separator, { backgroundColor: theme.colors.border.default }]} />
   <SettingsRow
     label="Privacy Policy"
     onPress={handlePrivacyPolicy}
     icon={DocumentText}
   />
   ```

The URL is a placeholder - user must replace with actual hosted privacy policy URL before submission.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx expo start` and navigate to Settings, confirm Privacy Policy row appears in ABOUT section</verify>
  <done>Settings screen has Privacy Policy link in ABOUT section that opens URL</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create SCREENSHOT_PLAN.md</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/26-app-store-preparation/SCREENSHOT_PLAN.md</files>
  <action>
Create SCREENSHOT_PLAN.md documenting screenshot requirements:

1. **Required Size** (mandatory for App Store):
   - 6.9" iPhone: 1260 x 2736 pixels (portrait)
   - Device: iPhone 16 Pro Max simulator or equivalent

2. **Recommended Screenshots** (5-6 showing key features):
   | # | Screen | What to Show | Why |
   |---|--------|--------------|-----|
   | 1 | Home | Mascot, tier progress, daily goal | First impression, gamification |
   | 2 | Quiz Question | Active question with options | Core experience |
   | 3 | Correct Answer | Green success state, explanation | Feedback quality |
   | 4 | Results | Score, tier progress, share button | Achievement |
   | 5 | Library | Category browsing, search | Content depth |
   | 6 | Study Mode | Calm blue UI, explanation | Learning feature |

3. **Capture Process**:
   ```bash
   # Boot correct simulator
   xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 16 Pro Max"

   # Run in production mode (no dev tools)
   npx expo start --no-dev

   # Capture screenshot
   # Simulator: Cmd+S or File > Save Screen
   # CLI: xcrun simctl io booted screenshot ~/Desktop/screenshot-N.png
   ```

4. **Screenshot Checklist**:
   - [ ] Device status bar shows realistic time (not 9:41)
   - [ ] No debug overlays or dev menus visible
   - [ ] Data looks realistic (not lorem ipsum or test data)
   - [ ] Good progression state visible (mid-tier, some stats)

5. **Optional**: Device frames and marketing text overlays (can be added in Figma/Preview)
  </action>
  <verify>Read SCREENSHOT_PLAN.md and confirm: 6.9" size documented (1260x2736), at least 5 screens listed, capture process documented</verify>
  <done>SCREENSHOT_PLAN.md documents all screenshot requirements with capture instructions</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create and verify RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/26-app-store-preparation/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md</files>
  <action>
Create RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md with pre-submission verification:

1. **Configuration Checks**:
   - [ ] Bundle ID is customized (not placeholder)
   - [ ] Version is 1.0.0
   - [ ] Privacy manifest includes UserDefaults declaration
   - [ ] supportsTablet is false
   - [ ] eas.json ascAppId is set

2. **Content Checks**:
   - [ ] No placeholder text (Lorem ipsum, TBD, TODO)
   - [ ] No test data visible in default state
   - [ ] App name displays correctly

3. **Debug Feature Checks**:
   - [ ] DevSection only shows when __DEV__ is true
   - [ ] No console.log statements visible to users
   - [ ] No development-only buttons or features
   - [ ] Production build has no debug overlays

4. **Functionality Checks**:
   - [ ] App launches without crash
   - [ ] Quiz flow completes start to finish
   - [ ] All tabs navigate correctly
   - [ ] Settings toggles persist
   - [ ] Share functionality works

5. **Asset Checks**:
   - [ ] App icon displays correctly (1024x1024 source)
   - [ ] Splash screen appears on launch
   - [ ] All images load (no broken images)

6. **How to Verify Production Build**:
   ```bash
   # Create production build for simulator
   eas build --platform ios --profile preview

   # Or test release mode locally
   npx expo start --no-dev --minify
   ```

Mark items as verified during execution where possible (read code to confirm __DEV__ guards, etc.).
  </action>
  <verify>Read RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md and confirm all sections exist; verify __DEV__ guard on DevSection by reading settings.tsx</verify>
  <done>RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md exists with all verification categories and key items verified</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
    - Privacy Policy link added to Settings screen
    - SCREENSHOT_PLAN.md with capture specifications
    - RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md with pre-submission checks

  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run `npx expo start` in medtriad directory
    2. Navigate to Settings tab
    3. Verify "Privacy Policy" row appears in ABOUT section
    4. Tap Privacy Policy - should attempt to open URL (will fail with placeholder)
    5. Review RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md items - confirm no obvious issues in current build
    6. Confirm dev tools only appear when running in development mode
